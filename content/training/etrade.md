As a development shop we have become more attracted to the use of Go in our frameworks. We realized we needed a professional to bring us up to speed and assist everyone in his or her use of Go.  We were very lucky to find Brian Ketelsen.  Some of the members of out team have been following Brian’s blogs and have adopted many of his practices.  The class he provided went way beyond anything we expected.  His lecture style fit perfectly with our team and his insights were extremely helpful.  The hands on labs he provided helped to clear up many of the questions we had regarding Go.

Please find below some of the comments from those who took the class:

“This training can be extended to various other employees to meet the organization goals of modernizing our platform”

“I like the coverage and depth of this training”

“The instructor was knowledgeable about the subject.  Strongly Agree 10”

If you are looking for Go or Kubernetes Training, Brian is the one to select!
