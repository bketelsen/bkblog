I am developing a suite of free and paid video training courses covering a wide variety of topics related to Go, API development, and distributed computing.  View the [course listing](http://learn.brianketelsen.com) and find the classes that meet your needs.  All courses come with a money back guarantee.  You can progress through your training at your own pace at a fraction of the cost of in-person training.
