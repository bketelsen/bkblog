I had the pleasure of speaking at [abstractions](http://abstractions.io) about code generation and using a design as your Single Source of Truth.

## Generate All The Things 
I won't replicate the content of the talk in this post, you can get a PDF of the talk [here](/talks/2016-10-19-abstractions.pdf).  I thoroughly enjoyed the conference and it was awesome to see so many people excited about code generation.  Thanks to everyone who came!
