With almost 25 years in software development and management, I've got a lot of experience to call upon in my consulting and training.  Here's a quick overview: <!--more-->

* DBA Experience - MSSQL, Sybase, mysql DBA for companies big (IBM) and small
* Data Warehouse - Before it was called _big data_ we called them data warehouses.  I've built some big ones.
* Distributed Applications - big deployments across multiple datacenters.  Coordination, consensus, transactions...  
* DevOps - When I was a kid we called it "can't afford an ops team".
* Containers/Orchestration - I've managed Rancher, Kubernetes, CoreOS, and DCOS clusters and containerized some things that probably shouldn't be containerized.
